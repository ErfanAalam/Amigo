# Expo AV Deprecation Notice

## Current Status
This project is currently using `expo-av` version 15.1.7, which has been deprecated and will be removed in Expo SDK 54.

## Warning Message
You may see this warning in your console:
```
[expo-av]: Expo AV has been deprecated and will be removed in SDK 54. Use the `expo-audio` and `expo-video` packages to replace the required functionality.
```

## What This Means
- `expo-av` is still functional in Expo SDK 53 (current version)
- The package will be completely removed in SDK 54
- We need to migrate to the new packages before upgrading to SDK 54

## Current Usage in This Project
The following components use `expo-av`:
- `components/MediaMessage.tsx` - For audio playback
- `components/VoiceRecorder.tsx` - For voice recording

## Migration Plan
When the official `expo-audio` and `expo-video` packages become available:

1. **Install new packages:**
   ```bash
   npm install expo-audio expo-video
   ```

2. **Update imports:**
   - Replace `import { Audio } from 'expo-av'` with `import { Audio } from 'expo-audio'`
   - Replace `import { Video } from 'expo-av'` with `import { Video } from 'expo-video'`

3. **Update app.json:**
   - Replace `"expo-av"` plugin with `"expo-audio"` and `"expo-video"` plugins

4. **Update package.json:**
   - Remove `"expo-av": "^15.1.7"`
   - Add `"expo-audio": "~1.0.0"` and `"expo-video": "~1.0.0"`

## Why We're Not Migrating Now
- The official `expo-audio` and `expo-video` packages are not yet available for SDK 53
- `expo-av` still works perfectly in the current SDK version
- We'll migrate when upgrading to SDK 54 or when the new packages become stable

## Action Required
- **None for now** - the app will continue to work normally
- **Before SDK 54 upgrade** - we must complete the migration
- **Monitor** - check for official package releases
